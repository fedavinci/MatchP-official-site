This section answers some common questions about the Match Protocol (MatchP) project.
### About the MATCH Token
- What is the MATCH token?
MATCH is the core value carrier of the ecosystem, used for staking to generate VOTE, unlocking platform features, paying for AI Agent services, and participating in future community governance.
- How to acquire MATCH tokens?
Participate in early contribution events, purchase on supported exchanges, and stake to invest in specific events, AI Agents, or other projects.
- What is the utility of staking MATCH?
Generates exclusive VOTE, unlocks advanced features, pays for AI Agent services, and may yield protocol annualized returns.
- What is the total supply of MATCH?
The initial total supply is 1 billion, with future gradual increases based on staking and investment.
### About the VOTE Token
- What is the VOTE token?
The exclusive contribution record credential for specific event or AI Agent cycles, used to quantify participation and settle earnings.
- How to acquire VOTE tokens?
Obtained by staking MATCH, bound to a specific cycle, with the generation ratio set by the principal.
- What is the utility of the VOTE token?
Records contributions within a specific cycle, proportionally exchanged for the profit share of events/AI Agents (potentially in MATCH or USDC).
- Is the VOTE token tradable?
The value of the VOTE token is directly related to specific event or AI Agent cycles and is destroyed upon settlement. Therefore, it is not intended for secondary market trading in the early stages of protocol development. However, with wider adoption of MatchP, potential DEX trading markets could form for high-potential events, allowing early investors to trade their VOTE at appropriate times.
### About AI Agent Integration
- How to use AI Agents on the platform?
Use MATCH tokens for payment to access various AI Agent services, such as event predictions and information retrieval. Some AI Agents may support private customization.
- How are AI Agent earnings distributed?
A portion is allocated to the Agent owners, and a portion may be awarded to data contributors in the form of VOTE.
### About Funds Security and Governance
- How does Match Protocol ensure user fund security?
Employs a multi-signature framework to manage public funds and critical operations, with plans for regular security audits and a bug bounty program.
- Who manages Match Protocol?
Governance will gradually decentralize, with MATCH holders having significant future voting rights. Currently, the core team and foundation are leading development and initial management.
- How can the community participate in protocol governance?
Initially through discussions on Telegram, followed by submitting proposals and participating in discussions on the official forum, with future voting rights for MATCH holders.
### About Platform Usage
- How to participate in event or AI Agent-related activities on Match Protocol?
Register a platform account, acquire MATCH tokens, and participate in relevant events or AI Agent-related activities based on your interests (e.g., staking MATCH to obtain VOTE for predictions).
