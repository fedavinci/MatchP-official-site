title: How Q&A Assistant​ AI Agent​​ Can Work with MCP
---

While RAG and TEE are foundational technologies for  Q&A Assistant​ AI Agent​​, integrating MCP can further enhance their performance and reliability:
1. Distributed Knowledge Retrieval and Negotiation: Multiple  Q&A Assistant​ AI Agent​​ Agents can retrieve relevant information from different knowledge sources in parallel. They can then use the MCP protocol to securely negotiate and aggregate these retrieved snippets, forming more comprehensive and authoritative answers. For example, one Agent might excel at retrieving schedule information, while another specializes in player data; MCP negotiation can integrate both.
1. Answer Consistency and Quality Assessment: Multiple  Q&A Assistant​ AI Agent​​ Agents can independently generate answers to the same question. Through MCP, these Agents can securely compare their answers and reach a consensus based on certain quality assessment criteria (e.g., reliability of information sources, completeness of the answer), selecting the best answer to present to the user.
1. Knowledge Base Updates and Synchronization: When the platform's knowledge base is updated, multiple  Q&A Assistant​ AI Agent​​ Agents can use the MCP protocol to securely synchronize these updates, ensuring that all Agents provide the latest and most consistent information.
1. Specialized Knowledge Routing: Different  Q&A Assistant​ AI Agent​​ Agents may specialize in different knowledge domains (e.g., specific sports or match types). MCP can help route user questions to the most knowledgeable Agent for a given query, improving the accuracy and expertise of the answer.
### Incentives & Security Mechanisms ( Q&A Assistant​ AI Agent​​)
- Rewards:
    - Rewarded based on the accuracy, relevance, timeliness, and user satisfaction of their answers.
    - Provide platform token rewards or special privileges to incentivize Agents to provide high-quality services.
- Penalties:
    - Agents providing incorrect, misleading, or irrelevant information will be penalized, such as having their priority lowered or their services temporarily restricted.
    - Agents maliciously attempting to access or leak user privacy or sensitive knowledge base information will face severe penalties, including the revocation of their Agent status.
