title: Staking & AI Agent Model
---

This model describes how AI Agent owners (including platform entities, event organizers, or individuals) can generate exclusive VOTE tokens by staking MATCH tokens, and how VOTE is used for their Agent's profit sharing, data contribution records, and platform incentives.
### Staking Mechanism
- Lock MATCH to Generate Exclusive VOTE: AI Agent owners stake MATCH to generate exclusive VOTE or other token. The ratio can be set by the owner or the platform. Exclusive VOTE is used for the Agent's profit sharing and data contribution value recording.
### VOTE as Profit Sharing and Data Contribution Record
- Revenue Distribution: When users or match organizers utilize the AI Agent, the owner earns revenue (in MATCH or other tokens).
- VOTE Records Data Contribution:
    - AI Agent users can choose to use their AI Agent privately.
    - AI Agents can also use data contributed by other users, encrypted via MatchP.
    - Any AI Agent that acquires this data will return a specific amount of VOTE or other tokens to the data contributor, serving as a record of profit sharing within a specific period.
    - This contribution also includes but is not limited to providing various other services to the AI Agent (e.g., model optimization, feedback correction), with contribution value settled in VOTE.
VOTE Incentive Mechanism:
- Higher Stake, Higher Returns: AI Agent owners who stake more MATCH also Earn 10% Match annualized return from MatchP.
- Data Contribution Value Representation: VOTE, as a reward for data contribution, directly reflects the contributor's value to the AI Agent's growth.
Example Flow (Q&A Assistant​):
1. Owner Staking: Developer Alice stakes 500 MATCH to generate 500,000 exclusive VOTE for her Q&amp;A Assistant​ AI Agent​ (Knowledge Spirit), at a ratio of 1 MATCH : 1000 VOTE.
2. Agent Usage and Data Contribution: User Bob hosts a city-level basketball event and uses and online deploys the basketball Q&A Assistant​ AI Agent​ "Little Ball," paying 100 MATCH. During usage, Bob continuously feeds Little Ball with his organized Q&amp;A materials, basketball data, and provides the latest data feedback, making Little Ball increasingly intelligent and knowledgeable about basketball events.
3. VOTE Contribution Record: According to platform rules, Bob's provided event-related information is rich and high-value. The platform records a return of 5000 VOTE to Bob's account as a reward for his data contribution. This VOTE can serve as Bob's profit-sharing entitlement in the future earnings of this AI Agent.
4. Profit Settlement: Alice can periodically receive profit settlement in MATCH or USDC from the platform based on the amount of exclusive VOTE she has accumulated. Simultaneously, Bob can also participate in the profit sharing of this AI Agent based on the amount of VOTE he earned for his data contributions.
