title: Match Protocol
description: Decentralized Infrastructure for Match Networks & AI-Powered Coordination
---

Match Protocol​​ (abbreviated as MatchP) is an open-source blockchain and AI-powered foundational protocol for global match networks. By establishing a decentralized and standardized universal model for competitions, MatchP enables the creation of personalized models tailored to various types of  matchs. This protocol provides freely accessible underlying infrastructure for globalmatch organizers, registration platforms, and participants, with its core value lying in achieving transparent and intelligent MATCH organization. Through collaborative ecosystem contributions, MatchP enhances engagement and amplifies the impact of competitions.
### 1. What is Match Protocol?
Match Protocol is a decentralized network enabling:
- Match Standardization: Create customizable templates for competitions/elections
- Tokenized Governance: staking MATCH generate VOTE tokens for allocote profits
- AI-Optimized Operations: Machine learning-enhanced match coordination
- Multi-Chain Support: Solana MVM + EVM-compatible chains (future)
## Quick Overview
- On Match Protocol, you can Invest any MATCH or other token in one match, Earn 10% annualized return from MatchP,daily interest, settled upon withdrawal. Also you can  buy and sell VOTE representing future match profits.
- VOTE in every match outcomes are always priced nearly $1.00 USDC, and every match must disclose its income and expenditures publicly. Each VOTE token represents a proportional share of the match's profits—the higher the profits, the greater the value of the VOTE tokens.
- Each AI Agent can generate its exclusive VOTE token or other utility tokens. Accessing an AI Agent's services requires payment in MATCH or USDC, if use MATCH, MATCH tokens support flexible staking options (monthly/annual).
- Users retain control over whether to authorize the AI Agent's use of MATCH data for model training. Contributors earn VOTE tokens by providing computational resources, data, or expertise. All VOTE holders will receive proportional annual profit-sharing from the AI Agent's revenue based on their ownership stake.
- Each match integrates three core modules: intelligent schedule management, real-time scoring systems, and  prediction functions. Platforms can choose between two access models: stake MATCH tokens to generate match-specific VOTE tokens and unlock full protocol privileges, or directly utilize designated tokens (e.g., USDC, SOL) for pay-per-use access to individual functional modules.
## UeFun: One of Match Protocol's Applications

    - Scoring methods can include star ratings, numerical ratings, or the selection of custom evaluation dimensions.
- User Identity and Weight Recognition:
    - Professional/Expert Verification: The system can integrate professional certification or expert identification mechanisms. Verified users will have higher weighting when scoring. The authentication method requires manual addition of either a did (Decentralized Identity) or email address, with each did permitted to cast only one VOTE.
    - NFT Weighting: The system can assign scoring weight based on the quantity or type of specific NFTs held by a user. Holding rare or specific series of NFTs may grant higher scoring influence.
    - Platform Data Weighting: The platform can assign scoring weight to users based on its own user data (e.g., historical participation, contribution, professional field).
    - Minimum Weight Participation: For users without any special identity or data support, a minimum scoring weight will be assigned by default. Their evaluations will still be included in the final results, but their influence will be relatively smaller.
- Score Aggregation and Calculation:
    - The system will collect scoring data from all users in real-time.
    - Based on the different weights of users, a weighted average of the scores will be calculated to determine the final real-time score.
    - The score aggregation algorithm needs to be flexible and configurable to adapt to different scenarios.
- Score Result Display:
    - The weighted average score results will be updated and displayed in real-time.
    - Optionally, the distribution of scores from users with different weights can be displayed to provide more comprehensive evaluation information.

## Staking & AI Agent Model
This model describes how AI Agent owners (including platform entities, event organizers, or individuals) can generate exclusive VOTE tokens by staking MATCH tokens, and how VOTE is used for their Agent's profit sharing, data contribution records, and platform incentives.
### Staking Mechanism:
- Lock MATCH to Generate Exclusive VOTE: AI Agent owners stake MATCH to generate exclusive VOTE or other token. The ratio can be set by the owner or the platform. Exclusive VOTE is used for the Agent's profit sharing and data contribution value recording.
### VOTE as Profit Sharing and Data Contribution Record:
- Revenue Distribution: When users or match organizers utilize the AI Agent, the owner earns revenue (in MATCH or other tokens).
- VOTE Records Data Contribution:
    - AI Agent users can choose to use their AI Agent privately.
    - AI Agents can also use data contributed by other users, encrypted via MatchP.
    - Any AI Agent that acquires this data will return a specific amount of VOTE or other tokens to the data contributor, serving as a record of profit sharing within a specific period.
    - This contribution also includes but is not limited to providing various other services to the AI Agent (e.g., model optimization, feedback correction), with contribution value settled in VOTE.
VOTE Incentive Mechanism:
- Higher Stake, Higher Returns: AI Agent owners who stake more MATCH also Earn 10% Match annualized return from MatchP.
- Data Contribution Value Representation: VOTE, as a reward for data contribution, directly reflects the contributor's value to the AI Agent's growth.
Example Flow (Q&A Assistant​):
1. Owner Staking: Developer Alice stakes 500 MATCH to generate 500,000 exclusive VOTE for her Q&amp;A Assistant​ AI Agent​ (Knowledge Spirit), at a ratio of 1 MATCH : 1000 VOTE.
1. Agent Usage and Data Contribution: User Bob hosts a city-level basketball event and uses and online deploys the basketball Q&A Assistant​ AI Agent​ "Little Ball," paying 100 MATCH. During usage, Bob continuously feeds Little Ball with his organized Q&amp;A materials, basketball data, and provides the latest data feedback, making Little Ball increasingly intelligent and knowledgeable about basketball events.
1. VOTE Contribution Record: According to platform rules, Bob's provided event-related information is rich and high-value. The platform records a return of 5000 VOTE to Bob's account as a reward for his data contribution. This VOTE can serve as Bob's profit-sharing entitlement in the future earnings of this AI Agent.
1. Profit Settlement: Alice can periodically receive profit settlement in MATCH or USDC from the platform based on the amount of exclusive VOTE she has accumulated. Simultaneously, Bob can also participate in the profit sharing of this AI Agent based on the amount of VOTE he earned for his data contributions.

## 🗳️ MATCH And VOTE Token System
The MATCH Protocol (MatchP) ecosystem employs a carefully designed dual-token model, featuring the native utility token MATCH and the contribution record token for events and AI Agents, VOTE. These two tokens play unique and interdependent roles in the protocol's operation, incentives, value distribution, and the long-term sustainability of the ecosystem. MATCH will serve as the core token for future protocol community governance, while VOTE focuses on specific contributions.
MATCH Token: Core Value
MATCH is the primary value carrier within the MatchP ecosystem, serving the following core functions:
- Staking Mining and VOTE Generation: Users stake MATCH tokens to generate a corresponding amount of exclusive VOTE based on the principal's requirements. VOTE serves only the specific event or AI Agent task cycle, with principals having the flexibility to expand its usage scope.
- Platform Feature Access: Staking MATCH unlocks advanced features and privileges on the platform.
- AI Agent Service Payment and Private Deployment: Users and event organizers use MATCH to pay for the services of specific AI Agents and to privatize theirAI Agent Service Payment and Private Deployment: Users and event organizers use MATCH to pay for the services of specific AI Agents and to private deployment use.
- Staking Investment and Yield Sharing: Users can stake MATCH to invest in various specific events, AI Agents, or other projects, with annualized returns distributed monthly to the project's public investment address.
VOTE Token: Contribution Record for Matchs and AI Agents
The VOTE token is an exclusive contribution record credential within the specific cycle of an event or AI Agent. Its generation, use, and destruction are strictly tied to the user's participation in the specific activity.
- Generation Mechanism: Staking MATCH to Obtain Exclusive VOTE
    - Staking Binding: Users stake MATCH tokens, and the principal generates an appropriate amount of VOTE as needed. However, the generated VOTE serves only the corresponding event or AI Agent task cycle and cannot be used across different scenarios.
    - Exclusive Attribute: Each VOTE token is tagged with its source (e.g., Event ID or Agent ID), ensuring the accuracy and immutability of its contribution record.
- Core Functions: Contribution Quantification and Settlement Credential
    - Contribution Record: The VOTE quantity reflects the user's participation intensity within a specific cycle (e.g., prediction count, data contribution volume, task completion), serving as an objective contribution quantification metric.
    - Profit Distribution: At the end of the cycle, the VOTE tokens held by users are proportionally exchanged for the profit sharing of the corresponding event or AI Agent (e.g., cash USDC or MATCH rewards), realizing "contribution equals earnings."
    - Destruction Mechanism: Upon settlement completion, all VOTE tokens are automatically destroyed, and the staked MATCH is released back to the public investor accounts, avoiding inflationary pressure.
- Risk Control and Dynamic Adjustment
    - Breach Forfeiture: If an event or AI Agent exhibits breach behavior (e.g., data fabrication, financial fraud), the system will request the foundation to discuss the forfeiture of relevant VOTE tokens according to the rules, ensuring the authenticity of the records.
Innovative Advantages:
- Scenario Isolation: Detached from generalized governance rights, focusing on recording the contribution value of a single activity, reducing token functional complexity.
- Dynamic Lifecycle: The entire lifecycle from generation to destruction is tied to specific business operations, avoiding "zombie tokens" that interfere with the ecosystem.
- Anti-Manipulation: Contribution records and settlement rules are enforced by smart contracts, avoiding human governance intervention.
- Staking Investment Lock-up: Users need to stake or invest MATCH to fully utilize MatchP protocol functions or enjoy higher returns, locking up MATCH circulation.

## 🛡️ Funds Security and Governance
Match Protocol views the security of funds and community-driven governance as cornerstones for long-term success. We are committed to building a transparent, robust, and community-driven protocol ecosystem.
### 1. Multi-Signature Framework:
To safeguard public funds and critical protocol changes, Match Protocol employs a multi-signature mechanism for project funds, as well as investments in events and AI Agents.
- Authorizing Parties and Threshold: Key operations such as investment fund transfers and core contract upgrades require the joint signature of a pre-defined number of trusted authorizing parties (e.g., 3/5, or unanimous agreement for critical situations). Authorizing parties for project funds include core team representatives, community-elected representatives, and independent security experts, ensuring a balance of power. Investment fund authorization primarily involves the event organizer and investors as the multi-sig team.
### 2. Community-Driven Governance:
The governance of Match Protocol will progressively decentralize, granting MATCH holders significant influence over the protocol's future direction.
- Proposal Lifecycle: Community members can submit proposals for improvements, new features, or parameter adjustments through the official forum or proposal platform. Proposals will undergo stages of community discussion, preliminary review, formal voting, and final execution.
- MATCH Governance Voting and Weight: MATCH holders possess the right to participate in community governance voting. Voting weight may be determined based on the quantity held or the duration of staking, balancing the influence of various holder sizes and encouraging long-term engagement.
- Governance Participation Incentives: Active participation in proposal discussions, providing valuable feedback, and voting will be considered contributions to the community. The foundation will reward contributors and participants with MATCH or USDC based on the quality and extent of their contributions. An alternative approach involves staking MATCH to generate VOTE, with the distribution of earned MATCH based on the quantity of VOTE held.
- Dispute Resolution Mechanism: In the event of significant disagreement within the community regarding a proposal, a dispute resolution mechanism will be initiated, such as introducing an arbitration committee or conducting a second round of voting, to reach a final consensus.
- Scope and Limitations of Governance: Community governance primarily encompasses non-core technical parameters of the protocol, the direction of ecosystem development, and proposals for fund utilization. Core technical upgrades and underlying architectural adjustments will remain under the guidance of the core team, who will, however, give due consideration to community feedback.Security & Governance

## ❓ Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)
This section answers some common questions about the Match Protocol (MatchP) project.
1. About the MATCH Token:
- What is the MATCH token?
MATCH is the core value carrier of the ecosystem, used for staking to generate VOTE, unlocking platform features, paying for AI Agent services, and participating in future community governance.
- How to acquire MATCH tokens?
Participate in early contribution events, purchase on supported exchanges, and stake to invest in specific events, AI Agents, or other projects.
- What is the utility of staking MATCH?
Generates exclusive VOTE, unlocks advanced features, pays for AI Agent services, and may yield protocol annualized returns.
- What is the total supply of MATCH?
The initial total supply is 1 billion, with future gradual increases based on staking and investment.
2. About the VOTE Token:
- What is the VOTE token?
The exclusive contribution record credential for specific event or AI Agent cycles, used to quantify participation and settle earnings.
- How to acquire VOTE tokens?
Obtained by staking MATCH, bound to a specific cycle, with the generation ratio set by the principal.
- What is the utility of the VOTE token?
Records contributions within a specific cycle, proportionally exchanged for the profit share of events/AI Agents (potentially in MATCH or USDC).
- Is the VOTE token tradable?
The value of the VOTE token is directly related to specific event or AI Agent cycles and is destroyed upon settlement. Therefore, it is not intended for secondary market trading in the early stages of protocol development. However, with wider adoption of MatchP, potential DEX trading markets could form for high-potential events, allowing early investors to trade their VOTE at appropriate times.
3. About AI Agent Integration:
- How to use AI Agents on the platform?
Use MATCH tokens for payment to access various AI Agent services, such as event predictions and information retrieval. Some AI Agents may support private customization.
- How are AI Agent earnings distributed?
A portion is allocated to the Agent owners, and a portion may be awarded to data contributors in the form of VOTE.
About Funds Security and Governance:
- How does Match Protocol ensure user fund security?
Employs a multi-signature framework to manage public funds and critical operations, with plans for regular security audits and a bug bounty program.
- Who manages Match Protocol?
Governance will gradually decentralize, with MATCH holders having significant future voting rights. Currently, the core team and foundation are leading development and initial management.
- How can the community participate in protocol governance?
Initially through discussions on Telegram, followed by submitting proposals and participating in discussions on the official forum, with future voting rights for MATCH holders.
About Platform Usage:
- How to participate in event or AI Agent-related activities on Match Protocol?
Register a platform account, acquire MATCH tokens, and participate in relevant events or AI Agent-related activities based on your interests (e.g., staking MATCH to obtain VOTE for predictions).
