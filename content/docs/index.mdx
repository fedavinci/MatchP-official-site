Match Protocol​​ (abbreviated as MatchP) is an open-source blockchain and AI-powered foundational protocol for global match networks. By establishing a decentralized and standardized universal model for competitions, MatchP enables the creation of personalized models tailored to various types of  matchs. This protocol provides freely accessible underlying infrastructure for globalmatch organizers, registration platforms, and participants, with its core value lying in achieving transparent and intelligent MATCH organization. Through collaborative ecosystem contributions, MatchP enhances engagement and amplifies the impact of competitions.
### What is Match Protocol?
Match Protocol is a decentralized network enabling:
- Match Standardization: Create customizable templates for competitions/elections
- Tokenized Governance: staking MATCH generate VOTE tokens for allocote profits
- AI-Optimized Operations: Machine learning-enhanced match coordination
- Multi-Chain Support: Solana MVM + EVM-compatible chains (future)
### Quick Overview
- On Match Protocol, you can Invest any MATCH or other token in one match, Earn 10% annualized return from MatchP,daily interest, settled upon withdrawal. Also you can  buy and sell VOTE representing future match profits.
- VOTE in every match outcomes are always priced nearly $1.00 USDC, and every match must disclose its income and expenditures publicly. Each VOTE token represents a proportional share of the match's profits—the higher the profits, the greater the value of the VOTE tokens.
- Each AI Agent can generate its exclusive VOTE token or other utility tokens. Accessing an AI Agent's services requires payment in MATCH or USDC, if use MATCH, MATCH tokens support flexible staking options (monthly/annual).
- Users retain control over whether to authorize the AI Agent's use of MATCH data for model training. Contributors earn VOTE tokens by providing computational resources, data, or expertise. All VOTE holders will receive proportional annual profit-sharing from the AI Agent's revenue based on their ownership stake.
- Each match integrates three core modules: intelligent schedule management, real-time scoring systems, and  prediction functions. Platforms can choose between two access models: stake MATCH tokens to generate match-specific VOTE tokens and unlock full protocol privileges, or directly utilize designated tokens (e.g., USDC, SOL) for pay-per-use access to individual functional modules.
