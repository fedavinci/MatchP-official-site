title: "Intelligent Schedule Management"
---

### Overview

A blockchain-anchored framework for dynamic match scheduling, combining on-chain governance with off-chain reality verification. This module provides a comprehensive suite of tools for managing and organizing match schedules within your platform. It goes beyond simple listing, offering intelligent features to optimize scheduling and user experience，establish a dynamic adversarial competition system that reduces gambling-related elements, enhances interaction and engagement between teams and spectators, and amplifies the match's overall influence.​​

### Core Concepts

- Blockchain Anchored: Utilizing smart contracts on the blockchain for transparent and immutable schedule management and outcome settlement.
- Decentralized Verification: Employing a decentralized oracle network to verify off-chain match data, ensuring accuracy and trust.
- Dynamic and Intelligent Scheduling: Leveraging AI and machine learning to optimize schedules, detect conflicts, and automate rescheduling.
- Outcome-Based Liquidity Pools: Implementing independent liquidity pools for head-to-head matches, enabling a peer-to-peer outcome prediction mechanism.
- Staking for Enhanced Privileges: Offering a tiered system where staking native tokens unlocks premium features and improved revenue splits.

### Core Features

- Multi-Source Verification: Cross-references stadium sensors (up to 90% accuracy) and official broadcaster feeds for reliable match data.
- Intelligent Grouping System: Supports customizable tournament stages (group, knockout, finals) with automatically generated bracket visualizations.
- Dynamic Format Configuration: Allows users to define competition types (single/double elimination, round-robin) with smart contract-automated scheduling logic.
- Outcome Pool Mechanism: Establishes independent liquidity pools for each head-to-head match, where the winner claims 99% of the opponent's pool (with a 1% protocol fee).
- Decentralized Arbitration System: Employs a triple verification mechanism for dispute resolution:
  - Primary Validation: Automatic settlement based on official match API integration (covers ~90% of cases).
  - Secondary Validation: A 2-hour challenge period for proposed resolutions, allowing users to dispute outcomes. Decentralized oracle network voting via a UMA-based application for 7-day dispute resolution.
- Anti-Cheating Design: Includes on-chain match monitoring for pool changes and automatic transaction freezing with forensic analysis for anomalies.
- Custom Rule Engine: Enables the definition of complex tournament rules using a Domain Specific Language (DSL).
- Reduces gambling-related elements:Unlike sportsbooks, you are not betting against "the house" – the counterparty to each opponent is another MatchP user.

### Staking & Revenue Model

- Staking Enhancement System:
  - Basic Mode: Any user can create matchs without staking, subject to a higher protocol fee (0.5% protocol / 0.2% platform / 0.3% organizer).
  - Staking Privilege: Staking MATCH generate VOTE unlocks:
    - Optimized fee split (0.1% protocol / 0.2% platform / 0.7% organizer).
- Capital Flow Model (Head-to-Head Matches):
  - Only player A bets 100 Funs/VOTE into Team 1 Pool.
  - Only player B bets 200 Funs/VOTE into Team 2 Pool.
  - Upon MATCH conclusion, the winner A receives 99% of the opponent's pool, 198 Funs/VOTE with 1% fee.
    Fee Distribution:
    Non-Staked : 1 Funs (protocol) + 0.4 Funs (platform) + 0.6 VOTE (organizer).
    Staked : 0.2 VOTE(protocol) + 0.4% VOTE (platform) + 1.4 VOTE (organizer).

### Technical Implementation

- Smart Contract Architecture:
  - TournamentScheduler Contract: Stores the base schedule, manages update proposals, and processes oracle confirmations. Includes logic for creating MATCHes with different fee rates based on staking status and the \_settleMATCH function for fund distribution.
- Decentralized Arbitration System: Integrates with official APIs and a decentralized oracle network (e.g., UMA) to provide a robust dispute resolution process.

### Developer Integration Guide

- API Endpoints: Provides RESTful API endpoints for creating tournaments and retrieving match data, including pool information and staking tiers.
- Custom Rule Engine: Allows developers to define intricate tournament rules using a dedicated DSL, offering flexibility in implementing various competition formats.

### Advantages

- Transparency and Immutability: Leverages blockchain technology for secure and auditable schedule management and outcome settlement.
- Accuracy and Trust: Employs a decentralized oracle network for reliable off-chain data verification.
- Efficiency and Automation: Utilizes AI and smart contracts to automate scheduling, conflict resolution, and payout distribution.
- Flexible Revenue Models: Offers tiered fee structures based on staking, Match's future profits, incentivizing platform participation.
- Developer-Friendly Integration: Provides comprehensive APIs and a custom rule engine for seamless integration into existing platforms.
