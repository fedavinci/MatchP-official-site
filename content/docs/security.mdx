title: Funds Security and Governance
---

Match Protocol views the security of funds and community-driven governance as cornerstones for long-term success. We are committed to building a transparent, robust, and community-driven protocol ecosystem.
### Multi-Signature Framework
To safeguard public funds and critical protocol changes, Match Protocol employs a multi-signature mechanism for project funds, as well as investments in events and AI Agents.
- Authorizing Parties and Threshold: Key operations such as investment fund transfers and core contract upgrades require the joint signature of a pre-defined number of trusted authorizing parties (e.g., 3/5, or unanimous agreement for critical situations). Authorizing parties for project funds include core team representatives, community-elected representatives, and independent security experts, ensuring a balance of power. Investment fund authorization primarily involves the event organizer and investors as the multi-sig team.
### Community-Driven Governance
The governance of Match Protocol will progressively decentralize, granting MATCH holders significant influence over the protocol's future direction.
- Proposal Lifecycle: Community members can submit proposals for improvements, new features, or parameter adjustments through the official forum or proposal platform. Proposals will undergo stages of community discussion, preliminary review, formal voting, and final execution.
- MATCH Governance Voting and Weight: MATCH holders possess the right to participate in community governance voting. Voting weight may be determined based on the quantity held or the duration of staking, balancing the influence of various holder sizes and encouraging long-term engagement.
- Governance Participation Incentives: Active participation in proposal discussions, providing valuable feedback, and voting will be considered contributions to the community. The foundation will reward contributors and participants with MATCH or USDC based on the quality and extent of their contributions. An alternative approach involves staking MATCH to generate VOTE, with the distribution of earned MATCH based on the quantity of VOTE held.
- Dispute Resolution Mechanism: In the event of significant disagreement within the community regarding a proposal, a dispute resolution mechanism will be initiated, such as introducing an arbitration committee or conducting a second round of voting, to reach a final consensus.
- Scope and Limitations of Governance: Community governance primarily encompasses non-core technical parameters of the protocol, the direction of ecosystem development, and proposals for fund utilization. Core technical upgrades and underlying architectural adjustments will remain under the guidance of the core team, who will, however, give due consideration to community feedback.Security & Governance
