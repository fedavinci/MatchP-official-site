title: "UeFun: One of Match Protocol's Applications"
---

### UeFun Introduction
UeFun is a Web3 collaborative co-building registration tool serving principals who organize various activities and events, and operate communities and spaces. Its slogan is: "From DAO to DAOs," primarily aiming to make community collaboration more efficient.
### UeFun's Integration with MatchP
UeFun will serve as a significant early-stage commercial application for Match Protocol (MatchP) integration experimentation. By exploring integration with MatchP, UeFun will be able to bring the following innovative experiences and value to principals and participants:
- A New Paradigm for Event and Activity Registration: Leveraging MatchP's decentralized nature, the event and activity registration process on UeFun will become more transparent, secure, and trustworthy. Participation records and contributions will be permanently stored on the blockchain.
- Contribution Incentives and Value Sharing: UeFun has its native Token, Indow. By utilizing the MatchP protocol, UeFun's co-builders can earn Indow rewards by contributing value to UeFun (e.g., promoting principals, acquiring users, assisting in community management, providing technical support, etc.). Moreover, the high level of attention attracted by an event itself constitutes a contribution to UeFun.
- Early Application Scenarios for the MatchP Ecosystem: UeFun will provide an early and real-world commercial application scenario for MatchP, validating its potential in event registration and community collaboration.
- AI Agent Empowerment: In the future, UeFun is expected to integrate AI Agent services from the MatchP ecosystem, providing principals with more intelligent event management tools, such as smart scheduling, participant behavior analysis, and automated notifications.
### The Future of Open-Source Co-Building
As an early commercial application integrated with MatchP, UeFun's success will serve as a demonstration for future registration platforms, communities with development capabilities, or event organizers. MatchP's goal is to build an open-source co-building platform where any qualified third party can independently connect to MatchP, collectively expanding its application scenarios and enriching the ecosystem, truly bringing about more and more Web3 Mass Adoption.
