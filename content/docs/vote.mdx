title: MATCH And VOTE Token System
---
The MATCH Protocol (MatchP) ecosystem employs a carefully designed dual-token model, featuring the native utility token MATCH and the contribution record token for events and AI Agents, VOTE. These two tokens play unique and interdependent roles in the protocol's operation, incentives, value distribution, and the long-term sustainability of the ecosystem. MATCH will serve as the core token for future protocol community governance, while VOTE focuses on specific contributions.


### MATCH Token: Core Value
MATCH is the primary value carrier within the MatchP ecosystem, serving the following core functions:
- Staking Mining and VOTE Generation: Users stake MATCH tokens to generate a corresponding amount of exclusive VOTE based on the principal's requirements. VOTE serves only the specific event or AI Agent task cycle, with principals having the flexibility to expand its usage scope.
- Platform Feature Access: Staking MATCH unlocks advanced features and privileges on the platform.
- AI Agent Service Payment and Private Deployment: Users and event organizers use MATCH to pay for the services of specific AI Agents and to privatize theirAI Agent Service Payment and Private Deployment: Users and event organizers use MATCH to pay for the services of specific AI Agents and to private deployment use.
- Staking Investment and Yield Sharing: Users can stake MATCH to invest in various specific events, AI Agents, or other projects, with annualized returns distributed monthly to the project's public investment address.

### VOTE Token: Contribution Record for Matchs and AI Agents
The VOTE token is an exclusive contribution record credential within the specific cycle of an event or AI Agent. Its generation, use, and destruction are strictly tied to the user's participation in the specific activity.
- Generation Mechanism: Staking MATCH to Obtain Exclusive VOTE
    - Staking Binding: Users stake MATCH tokens, and the principal generates an appropriate amount of VOTE as needed. However, the generated VOTE serves only the corresponding event or AI Agent task cycle and cannot be used across different scenarios.
    - Exclusive Attribute: Each VOTE token is tagged with its source (e.g., Event ID or Agent ID), ensuring the accuracy and immutability of its contribution record.
- Core Functions: Contribution Quantification and Settlement Credential
    - Contribution Record: The VOTE quantity reflects the user's participation intensity within a specific cycle (e.g., prediction count, data contribution volume, task completion), serving as an objective contribution quantification metric.
    - Profit Distribution: At the end of the cycle, the VOTE tokens held by users are proportionally exchanged for the profit sharing of the corresponding event or AI Agent (e.g., cash USDC or MATCH rewards), realizing "contribution equals earnings."
    - Destruction Mechanism: Upon settlement completion, all VOTE tokens are automatically destroyed, and the staked MATCH is released back to the public investor accounts, avoiding inflationary pressure.
- Risk Control and Dynamic Adjustment
    - Breach Forfeiture: If an event or AI Agent exhibits breach behavior (e.g., data fabrication, financial fraud), the system will request the foundation to discuss the forfeiture of relevant VOTE tokens according to the rules, ensuring the authenticity of the records.

### Innovative Advantages
- Scenario Isolation: Detached from generalized governance rights, focusing on recording the contribution value of a single activity, reducing token functional complexity.
- Dynamic Lifecycle: The entire lifecycle from generation to destruction is tied to specific business operations, avoiding "zombie tokens" that interfere with the ecosystem.
- Anti-Manipulation: Contribution records and settlement rules are enforced by smart contracts, avoiding human governance intervention.
- Staking Investment Lock-up: Users need to stake or invest MATCH to fully utilize MatchP protocol functions or enjoy higher returns, locking up MATCH circulation.
